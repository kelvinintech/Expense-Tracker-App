# The Expense Tracker

The purpose of this expense tracker is to give myself and my collaborator the opporunity to create a React App. For me (**Eugene**) this project is also providing me with my first opportunity at collaborating on a development project with someone. The application will be built using React and we will be using GitHub to make the appropriate changes neccessary.

I do plan on using this app as a foundation for other applications down the line because being able to quantify expense goes beyond the reach of just money. Eating, social interactions, task completion, etc.

Looking forward to learning!
